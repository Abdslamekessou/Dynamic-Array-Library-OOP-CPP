# 📦 Dynamic Array Implementation (OOP C++)

A console-based Dynamic Array data structure implemented in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
This project demonstrates how a dynamic array works internally, including manual memory management, resizing, and element manipulation, without using STL containers like vector.

# 📌 Features
# 🧱 Internal Structure

Dynamic Array implemented using raw pointers

Manual memory allocation (new[] / delete[])

No STL containers (vector, list, array)

Fully template-based for use with any data type

# ➕ Insertion Operations

Insert at a specific index

Insert at the beginning

Insert at the end

Insert before a given index

Insert after a given index

# ❌ Deletion Operations

Delete item by index

Delete first item

Delete last item

Delete item by value

Clear the entire array

# 🔍 Access & Update Operations

Get item by index

Set (update) item by index

Find index of a given value

# 🔄 Array Utilities

Resize the array (increase or decrease size)

Reverse array elements

Check if the array is empty

Get current array size

Print array contents

# 🖥️ Console Output

Clear and readable output of array contents, for example:
```
10  20  30  40  50
```

All operations are tested step-by-step using a console-based main() driver program.

# 🧠 Concepts Used

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Templates (template <class T>)

Dynamic memory allocation

Pointers

Encapsulation

Manual memory management

Core Data Structures (Dynamic Array)

# 🛠️ Technologies Used

Console-based application

Custom data structures (No STL)

# 🎯 Educational Purpose

This project is designed to:

Understand how dynamic arrays work internally

Learn how resizing affects memory

Practice pointer manipulation and memory safety

Prepare for technical interviews
